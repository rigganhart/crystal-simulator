  <h3>What's Going On</h3>
<p>  This site simulates opening multiple Premium Hero Crystals in Marvel Contest of Champions. All percentages and settings are "educated guesses" based on my own user experience since Kabam does not release their percentages</p>

  <h3>The Nitty Gritty</h3>
  <p>
    There are alot of assumptions made in the programming of this site about how COC works without seeing the actual source code of COC. please keep in mid these are all just assumptions based on game logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idea behind all this is that there are 3 tiers of rewards when you open a PHC. for lack of better terms I will use basic, rare, and super rare. Ex: 2star = basic; 3star = rare; 4star = super rare. This logic exists in pretty much all free to play games.
